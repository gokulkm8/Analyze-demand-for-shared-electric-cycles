# ABOUT THE COMPANY
**Yulu** is Indiaâ€™s leading micro-mobility service provider, which offers unique vehicles for the daily commute. Starting off as a mission to eliminate traffic congestion in India, Yulu provides the safest commute solution through a user-friendly mobile app to enable shared, solo and sustainable commuting.

Yulu zones are located at all the appropriate locations (including metro stations, bus stands, office spaces, residential areas, corporate offices, etc) to make those first and last miles smooth, affordable, and convenient!

Yulu has recently suffered considerable dips in its revenues. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared electric cycles depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared electric cycles in the Indian market.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
The company wants to know:  

* Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market?
* How well those variables describe the electric cycle demands

# INSIGHTS
* Important parameters for predicting demand - **Season, Weather, ambient temperature & humidity**
* 2085476 users used rental bikes in the period of 2011-2012
* 81% of the users are registered and 18% are casual users
* 50% increase in casual users and 70% increase in registered users are noticed from 2011 to 2012
* Rental bikes are highly used in working days followed by weekends and holidays.
* Peak timing is at 8:00am in the morning and 5pm in the evening
* Maximum usage of rental bikes are during falls followed by summer and least used during spring
* Rental bikes are mostly used during clear weather and least used during light rain
* Usage of bikes are positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with humidity
* Temperature increases in the order of Spring < Winter < Summer < Fall
* Humidity increases in the order of Spring < Summer < Fall ~ Winter
* Season is a dependant feature for number of users of rental bikes . Mostly used during falls followed by summer season
* Weather is a dependant feature for number of users of rental bikes. Mostly used during clear weather followed by cloudy & misty and it is least used during light snow & rain
* Usage of bikes increased by 66% from 2011 to 2012
* Maximum usage happens in between June & September
  
# RECOMMENDATIONS
* Since the usage is highest on working days, it can be inferred that majority of the users are working professionals / school going children etc. YULU can collaborate with companies or schools to provide EV rental bike services at lesser amount which will increase the user count
* Usage is very less on weekends & holidays. So YULU can reduce the fare on these days to attract more users
* Usage is high on fall season when temperature is the highest in a year.. The bikes should be designed to work in those temperature ( max-40 degrees ) and humidity conditions especially since its an Electic Vehicle where cooling of important components such as battery, motor etc. becomes critical
* Spare parts availability to be ensured in all the service centres between June to September due to heavy usage and high ambient temperature
* At the same time, bike availability also to be ensured during the period to meet the user requirements without creating any delays for the customers
* Registered users accounts to 81% of the total users. YULU can provide special subscription features for the registered customers like rewards for a fixed km ride / contests especially during weekends which will increase the registered users further and also increase user engagement in weekends & holidays
* Usage is very low on rainy days. YULU can explore innovative ideas to make it possible to use the bikes on rainy weathers as well. It can be inbuilt systems or additional attachments. This will largely increase the user base
* Dynamic pricing strategy can be introduced by icnreasing the fare during peak hours and reduce the fare during normal hours
